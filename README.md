#WHAT IS PixelOS FOUR?
Pixel OS FOUR is the third revival (and the 4th version) in the Pixel OS series, this time being made in TURBOWARP.

#WHY TURBOWARP?
I chose turbowarp because of its MANY ADDONS. this means that Pixel OS FOUR can be more immersive than any version on scratch could.

#HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE?
the first release will probably come out next year, with a 'lite' version on scratch.

#WHAT DO YOU MEAN 'lite'?
the 'lite' version will be a scratch version of its TURBOWARP counter-part. only major releases (1.0,2.0,P.OS FIVE, ect.) will have 'lite' releases. P.S. might not use 'lite'
